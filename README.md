# Belly Button Biodiversity
What microorganisms live in our belly buttons? The Rob Dunn Lab dives into the mysteries of the belly button microflora to find out. 

The __Belly Button Biodiversity__ dashboard shows the most common microorganisms (particularly prokaryotes) isolated from the belly buttons of 153 volunteers and identified through DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. It shows the most common prokaryotes in all volunteers and also per volunteer. Pie charts exhibit the proportions (%) of the top 10 "organised taxonomic units" (OTUs). Bubble charts provide a different perspective as the bubble sizes indicate the concentrations of each OTU against 19 others.

Head over to the project [wiki](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/wiki) for full details of the documentation. The deployed dashboard, on the other hand, can be accessed at [https://still-brook-99773.herokuapp.com/](https://still-brook-99773.herokuapp.com/).
